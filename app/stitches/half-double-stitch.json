    "Step 1 : To create the half double stitch place the hook behind the yarn (that is coming from the yarn ball).",
    "Step 2 : Insert into the first loop (second if on a new row).",
    "Step 3 : Push through the loop like with the single stitch and wrap around the yarn.",
    "Step 4 : Pull through all of the loops on the hook so that when you pull it out it will only have one loop on the hook.",
    "Step 5 : Continue this down the row, flipping like above for each new row.",
    "Step 6 : Continuing this method will gives you a bit of a differnent pattern than the single stitch."
