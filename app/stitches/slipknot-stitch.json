    "Step 1 : When starting off any crochet project, you’ll need to make a slip knot. First hold your crochet hook in your hand like you would a pencil.",
    "Step 2 : Leave about a 4″ tail and flip the tail over the yarn coming off of the yarn ball.",
    "Step 3 : Flip the tail under the loop that was created so that it is going down the center of the loop from behind.",
    "Step 4 : Pull the tail slightly through the loop.",
    "Step 5 : Place your hook into the new top look created (the smaller of the two loops).",
    "Step 6 : Pull the loop tightly around the hook and this is your slip knot, ready to create your first chain stitch."
